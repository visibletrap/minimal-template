# minimal

A minimalist template to get started with Clojure project.


## Usage

#### Clojure project
`lein new minimal <your-project-name>`

#### ClojureScript + Figwheel project
`lein new minimal <your-project-name> +figwheel`

**Note** I brought most of the implementation from [the original figwheel template](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-template)
